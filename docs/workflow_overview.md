# Workflow Overview

This document describes the high-level flow across onboarding, offboarding, backups, and reporting.

1. **Onboarding**: Create user → assign license → add to groups → enroll device via Intune → verify MFA/CA.
2. **Offboarding**: Disable account → revoke sessions → archive data → remove device access → notify stakeholders.
3. **Backups**: Compress & store → verify hash → rotate retention.
4. **Reporting**: Export inventory → publish to Power BI or CSV for audits.
